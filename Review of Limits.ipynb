    "\n",
    "We can also take limits from the left and right side. For left side limits, we start from the left side (obviously), and approach the point in question ($a$) along the x-axis until we get ever so close to it without actually being at $x=a$. Basically, we get as close as we can to $x=a$ from the left side of the graph. The same thing applies for right side limits, but, well, you know, from the right side.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the left and right side limits match up, then the limit at $x=a$ exists. If not, then the limit does not exist (we say that the limit is DNE).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also have limits of functions that normally would not exist at a given point. For example, we take $f(x) = \\frac{x^2-16}{x+4}$. We see that there is a discontinuity at $x=-4$ since the denominator is 0 (remember, dividing by zero is a big no-no). However, and I repeat, however, we see that the limit is in the form $\\frac{0}{0}$, so a limit can be computed, even though $f(x)$ is discontinuous at $x=-4$. We now go forth with computing the limit at $x=-4$, so we get,\n",
